## The objective here is to create our build tools. We end up re-downloading the
## build tools and curl tools because these are not supposed to exist on the
## selma/runner container.
##
## The pickett side assumes that go is installed and the GOPATH and PATH set 
## correctly if you invoke a GoBuild in a container.

#RUN hg clone -u release https://code.google.com/p/go
#WORKDIR /opt/go/src
#RUN ./all.bash
#RUN ln -s /opt/go/bin/go /usr/bin/go

# These env vars are needed by various build-related activities. This does not
# include GOPATH, that's set in external.
